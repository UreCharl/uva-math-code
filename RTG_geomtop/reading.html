<h1 class="mb-5">Geometry/Topology Reading Courses</h1>

Each semester one or more geometry/topology faculty or postdocs organize a seminar-style reading course for
graduate students. Usually these courses center around a book or collection of articles, which students study on their own
and present in course meetings. Current courses are listed below; more information can be found by contacting the organizer. 

Students are encouraged to suggest topics for future reading courses!

###### Fall 2019

**Floer Theory**: The first few weeks will be spent on chapters 1-4 of Audin and Damien's 
book _Morse Theory and Floer Homology_, which develop the construction of (cellular) homology of a manifold from a Morse function.
Subsequently students will independently learn about one or more versions of Floer homology: possibilities include continuing
in Audin-Damien to learn Hamiltonian Floer homology, related notions such as Floer homology for symplectomorphisms or for
Lagrangian intersections, or more diverse incarnations like symplectic homology, contact homology, instanton Floer homology,
monopole Floer homology, Heegaard Floer homology, and variations of these for knots in 3-dimensional manifolds. 
Organizer: Tom Mark.
